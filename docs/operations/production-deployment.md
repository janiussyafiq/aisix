Production deployment starts with a correct bootstrap config, a reachable
etcd cluster, and a clear decision about whether the gateway runs in
standalone or managed mode.

## Production Runtime

At startup, AISIX loads bootstrap configuration, connects to etcd, builds the
initial resource view, starts the configuration watcher, builds shared proxy
components, and binds the proxy listener. In standalone mode, it also binds the
admin listener.

A process can be alive while still unable to serve useful traffic if the
configuration store, loaded resources, or provider resources are not
ready. Always verify the request path, not only process startup.

Match the production playbook to the deployment mode. In standalone mode, AISIX
binds the local admin API when configured. Gateway resources are managed
through the admin API, and those writes are stored as etcd-backed resources.
The standalone playground is part of the local admin API.

In managed data-plane mode, AISIX does not expose the standalone admin listener
or standalone playground locally. AISIX Cloud manages resources and projects
them into the connected data plane. Bootstrap uses the Cloud certificate bundle
and managed path.

## Deployment Baseline

For a first production rollout, use this baseline unless you have a specific
reason to diverge. Run etcd separately from the gateway process, expose the
proxy listener only to intended callers, and keep the admin listener on
loopback or a private network. Enable TLS on listeners that leave local
development.

Start with memory cache unless Redis is required. Before considering the
deployment ready, create at least one provider key, model, and caller API key
and verify that the model can serve a real request.

If you choose Redis for cache, `cache.redis.url` must be present in the
bootstrap config or startup fails.

## Verify Readiness

Before routing real traffic, confirm the bootstrap config matches the intended
mode, the proxy listener is reachable from intended callers, and at least one
model alias can serve a real request. In standalone mode, also confirm etcd is
reachable and the admin listener is private. For deployments with TLS or mTLS,
confirm the configured certificate and key files are readable.

After deployment, run production checks. `GET /livez` on the proxy listener
should return `200`. In standalone mode, admin-listener `GET /livez` and
`GET /admin/v1/health` should also return `200`. `GET /v1/models` with a test
key should return the expected caller-visible aliases. One real request per
endpoint family in use should succeed through the proxy, and metrics, logs, or
configured exporters should show the smoke-test request path.

## Shutdown Behavior

AISIX handles graceful shutdown on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`. During
shutdown, the server stops accepting new work and coordinates listener
shutdown with background tasks.

Treat a failing `/livez` during shutdown as expected. Do not treat it as
an unexpected process failure unless the process was not meant to be
draining.

## Troubleshooting

### The Process Is Up but Real Requests Fail

Treat this as a configuration, propagation, credential, or upstream path
problem. Check `/v1/models`, admin health in standalone mode, and one
real request with the caller API key that should have access.

### The Admin API Is Missing

Check whether the deployment is running as a managed data plane. Managed
mode does not bind the standalone admin listener.
