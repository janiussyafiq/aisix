Upgrade AISIX AI Gateway conservatively when production traffic depends
on dynamic configuration and provider behavior.

Treat an upgrade as a behavior change to verify, not only as a binary
replacement.

## Compatibility Checks

Before widening traffic to a new version, verify the new binary parses the
configured bootstrap file and starts with the expected listeners. Confirm
etcd-backed resources are readable, model aliases resolve as expected, and
caller-facing proxy behavior still matches the applications that call the
gateway.

Also verify provider-specific behavior for each endpoint family you use. In
managed deployments, confirm managed bootstrap and projection still work before
widening traffic.

## Upgrade Flow

Review release notes or change notes for configuration, provider, and endpoint
behavior before starting the rollout. Start the new version without sending
full production traffic, then confirm proxy liveness and, in standalone mode,
admin health.

Before widening traffic, confirm `GET /v1/models` with a representative caller
API key, send one real request on each endpoint family your clients use, and
check logs, metrics, headers, and usage events for the upgraded path.

## Compatibility Risks

Pay special attention to bootstrap config fields, etcd TLS and trust roots,
dynamic resource schemas, cache backend selection, provider adapter behavior,
managed certificate bootstrap, `/dp/*` connectivity, Cloud projection, and
budget workflows.

If you use several endpoint families, test each one. A successful
chat-completions request does not confirm that embeddings, streaming,
Anthropic Messages, or passthrough behavior is compatible.

## Rollback Considerations

Before upgrading, decide which bootstrap config version will be used for
rollback. Also verify whether dynamic resources written during the upgrade
remain readable by the previous version, whether provider-key, model, or policy
changes were made during the rollout, and whether managed projection state
needs time to converge after rollback.

## Troubleshooting

### The New Version Starts but One Endpoint Behaves Differently

Treat this as a compatibility issue even if health checks are green.
Check the failing endpoint against a known-good request path, then
inspect provider adapter behavior, request headers, response format, and
policy resources.
