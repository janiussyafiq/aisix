When AISIX AI Gateway moves from a local quickstart into a real environment,
focus on the running data plane: how it starts, which listeners to expose, how
to verify traffic, and how to diagnose failures in production-like deployments.

If you are still creating provider keys, models, caller keys, or runtime
policies, start with [Configuration overview](../configuration/overview.md)
first.

## Deployment Path

Start with [Production deployment](production-deployment.md) when the gateway is
moving toward real traffic. It sets the baseline for bootstrap configuration,
listeners, etcd, cache, and the first production checks.

Before exposing the proxy, use
[Network and security](network-and-security.md) and
[TLS and mTLS](tls-and-mtls.md) to set listener placement, credential
handling, and encrypted transport.

After the runtime is deployed, verify the caller-to-provider path with
[Health checks](health-checks.md), [Metrics and logs](metrics-and-logs.md),
and [Testing and verification](testing-and-verification.md). If a running
deployment does not behave as expected, continue with
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). Before widening traffic to a new
version, review [Upgrades and compatibility](upgrades-and-compatibility.md).

## Standalone and Managed Differences

Standalone gateways expose a local admin listener when configured. Use it for
admin health, metrics, OpenAPI, and dynamic-resource management, and keep it on
a private admin network.

Managed data planes receive projected resources from AISIX Cloud and use the
managed mTLS path instead of the standalone admin API. For managed operation,
pair these runtime checks with [AISIX Cloud overview](../cloud/overview.md) and
[Gateway certificates and managed data plane](../cloud/gateway-certificates-and-managed-dp.md).
