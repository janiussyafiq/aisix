Production verification should check the full caller-to-provider path,
not only process startup.

## Verification Flow

Start with proxy liveness, then confirm admin liveness in standalone mode.
After the expected provider key, model, and caller API key exist, verify
configuration propagation on the proxy path and send one real request to the
upstream provider. Finish by confirming that logs, metrics, headers, or usage
events show the request.

The final request matters most. A gateway can be alive while caller
authentication, model resolution, provider credentials, or upstream
network access is still broken.

Configuration propagation is asynchronous. Prefer probes that confirm the
desired state rather than fixed sleeps.

Use positive probes that confirm the expected state is visible. Poll
`/v1/models` until the expected model alias appears, poll the exact endpoint
you use until a known propagation error disappears, and check
`GET /admin/v1/health` in standalone mode when you need to confirm that the
standalone admin API sees a fresh snapshot.

Avoid fixed sleeps after admin writes, process liveness alone, or a Cloud
playground result when the live managed data-plane path is what you need to
verify.

## Verify Request Behavior

For each critical path, verify both the caller-visible result and the
management signals. Check the expected HTTP status, response format, and model
alias behavior; provider-side logs, metrics, or errors where they matter;
gateway headers such as `x-aisix-cache`, `x-aisix-call-id`,
`x-aisix-request-id`, or `Retry-After`; and operational telemetry such as
logs, metrics, usage events, or exporter output.

For a production-minded smoke test, cover both accepted and rejected traffic.
Use a valid caller API key to confirm the authenticated request path, then use
an invalid or unauthorized key to confirm caller access is enforced. Check
`GET /v1/models`, send one successful request for each endpoint family in use,
and verify any cache, guardrail, budget, or rate-limit policy that affects
production traffic.

## Deployment Mode Differences

In standalone mode, include admin API and admin health checks. In managed
mode, include managed data-plane heartbeat, projection, and live proxy
request checks.

Do not use the Cloud playground as the only signal for live managed traffic.
The playground is a Cloud UI check and does not exercise every managed
data-plane feature.

## Troubleshooting

### Health Checks Pass but Smoke Tests Fail

Trust the smoke tests. They are closer to real user behavior than
process liveness. Check model visibility, provider-key references, caller
API-key access, and upstream provider connectivity.

### A Fixed Sleep Works Locally but Flakes in Production

Replace the sleep with a positive probe, such as polling `/v1/models` or
the exact endpoint that must become ready.
