An **adapter** is the upstream protocol family AISIX uses after it resolves a
caller-facing model alias to a provider key.

This reference explains how one model alias can route to OpenAI,
Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
without changing the caller-facing API.

For endpoint-by-endpoint support, see [Provider compatibility](provider-compatibility.md).

## Choose the Right Adapter

Choose the adapter that matches the upstream API format, not only the provider
name.

| If the upstream speaks | Use `adapter` | Common examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible chat-completions | `openai` | OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Together.ai, Fireworks, Perplexity, vLLM, SGLang, Ollama, private OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| Anthropic Messages | `anthropic` | Anthropic native Messages API |
| AWS Bedrock Runtime | `bedrock` | Anthropic Claude on Bedrock, Bedrock Converse publishers |
| Google Vertex AI publisher routes | `vertex` | Gemini, Anthropic Claude on Vertex, Vertex MaaS publisher rails |
| Azure OpenAI Service | `azure-openai` | Azure OpenAI deployments with API-key or Entra ID authentication |

If a provider exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, it usually uses
`adapter: "openai"` even when its `provider` value is not `openai`. For
example, a DeepSeek provider key can use `provider: "deepseek"` and
`adapter: "openai"`.

`provider` identifies the upstream vendor or endpoint. It is an open string,
such as `openai`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`, `amazon-bedrock`, `google-vertex`,
`azure`, or a private endpoint label.

`adapter` identifies the protocol family AISIX knows how to encode. It is the
closed set listed above.

This distinction lets AISIX support additional providers without changing the
data plane for every vendor. A new OpenAI-compatible provider can keep its
own provider identity, base URL, telemetry metadata, and model IDs while still
using the OpenAI adapter family.

For provider-key fields and validation rules, see
[Provider key schema](provider-key-schema.md).

## Adapter Families

### OpenAI Adapter

Uses the OpenAI chat-completions API format.

This is the broadest family. It covers OpenAI itself, public
OpenAI-compatible providers, and private OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
Authentication usually uses `Authorization: Bearer`, although some compatible
providers use provider-specific credential headers behind the same family.

See [OpenAI-compatible API](../integration/openai-compatible-api.md),
[OpenAI-compatible vendor upstream](../integration/upstream-openai-compat.md),
and [Bring your own endpoint](../configuration/byo-endpoint.md).

### Anthropic Adapter

Uses the Anthropic Messages API format.

Authentication uses `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version`. Use this family when
the upstream provider is Anthropic-native, not merely when the caller sends an
Anthropic-style request to AISIX.

See [Anthropic Messages](../integration/anthropic-messages.md).

### Bedrock Adapter

Uses AWS Bedrock Runtime.

AISIX signs outbound requests with AWS SigV4. Anthropic Claude on Bedrock uses
the Bedrock `/invoke` path with an Anthropic Messages body. Other supported
publishers use Bedrock Converse.

See [AWS Bedrock upstream](../integration/upstream-bedrock.md).

### Vertex Adapter

Uses Google Vertex AI publisher routes.

AISIX authenticates with a GCP OAuth2 Bearer token, either minted from a
service-account credential or supplied as a pre-minted token. It then uses
publisher-specific Vertex paths such as `:generateContent`,
`:rawPredict`, or OpenAI-compatible MaaS endpoints.

See [Google Vertex AI upstream](../integration/upstream-vertex.md).

### Azure OpenAI Adapter

Uses Azure OpenAI Service deployment routes.

AISIX builds Azure URLs from the provider key's resource host and the model's
upstream deployment name. Authentication uses either Azure's `api-key` header or
an Entra ID Bearer token.

See [Azure OpenAI upstream](../integration/upstream-azure-openai.md).

## Request Flow and Endpoint Support

A direct [model](../configuration/models.md) references a
[provider key](../configuration/provider-keys.md) through `provider_key_id`.
When a request reaches AISIX, the gateway authenticates the caller key,
checks model access, resolves the caller-facing alias to a model and provider
key, chooses the provider-specific or adapter-family request path, and then
renders the caller-facing response.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Client["Client request<br/>model: prod-chat"]
  Key["Caller API key<br/>allowed models"]
  Model["Model alias<br/>display_name: prod-chat"]
  ProviderKey["ProviderKey<br/>provider + adapter + secret + api_base"]
  Adapter["Selected adapter<br/>provider override or adapter family"]
  Upstream["Upstream provider"]

  Client --> Key --> Model --> ProviderKey --> Adapter --> Upstream
```

Only `openai` and `anthropic` use provider-specific handling for compatibility
with existing request paths. The adapter-family tier is the normal path for
Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, and OpenAI-compatible providers whose
provider value is not `openai`.

:::note
The caller-facing model name is the model's `display_name`. The upstream model
ID is the model's `model_name`. For normalized chat responses,
`response.model` echoes the caller-facing alias, not the upstream model ID.
:::

Adapters describe the upstream protocol family. They do not guarantee that
every proxy endpoint supports every provider.

For example:

| Endpoint | Support note |
| --- | --- |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | Broadest normalized chat path. |
| `/v1/responses` and `/v1/images/generations` | OpenAI-provider paths, not generic `openai` adapter paths. |
| `/v1/rerank` | Keyed by provider labels such as `openai`, `cohere`, and `jina`; it does not use the normal chat-completions path. |
| `/passthrough/:provider/*rest` | Uses a configured provider key and performs less gateway normalization. |

[Provider compatibility](provider-compatibility.md) lists endpoint support for
specific provider and endpoint combinations.

## Cloud Catalog and Self-Hosted Providers

In AISIX Cloud, the control plane maps catalog providers to adapter families and
projects provider keys to the data plane. Cloud users select the provider in
the managed workflow; the adapter and base URL are populated by the control
plane.

In self-hosted deployments, you set `provider`, `adapter`, `api_base`, and
`secret` directly on each provider key.

Featured or community catalog status affects AISIX Cloud web console
presentation. It does not change request handling. Runtime behavior depends on
the resolved model, provider key, provider identity, adapter, and connection
settings.
