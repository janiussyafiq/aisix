Gateway responses should be interpreted by response format before status code
alone. The response format determines which headers, error envelope, and status
codes apply in logs, clients, and automation.

AISIX has more than one response format. Identify the API that returned the
response, then use the matching header and error guidance.

## Choose the Response Format

Use the request path to decide which response format applies.

| Response came from | Error envelope | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible proxy routes such as `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/responses`, audio, images, and rerank | `{"error": {...}}` | [OpenAI-style proxy errors](#openai-style-proxy-errors) |
| Anthropic-style proxy routes such as `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | `{"type":"error","error": {...}}` | [Anthropic-style proxy errors](#anthropic-style-proxy-errors) |
| Provider passthrough routes under `/passthrough/:provider/*rest` | Upstream provider status and body | [Passthrough errors](#passthrough-errors) |
| Standalone Admin API routes under `/admin/*` | `{"error_msg":"..."}` | [Admin error envelope](#admin-error-envelope) |

## Proxy Response Headers

Operational headers vary by endpoint. Do not treat every header as universal
across every `/v1/*` route.

| Header | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| <nobr><code>x-aisix-call-id</code></nobr> | Appears on chat-completions responses. Use it to correlate one gateway call. |
| <nobr><code>x-aisix-request-id</code></nobr> | Appears on direct passthrough-style endpoints such as messages, responses, rerank, audio, and passthrough. Use it to correlate the proxied request path. |
| <nobr><code>x-aisix-served-by</code></nobr> | Appears on successful chat-completions routing responses. Use it to identify the direct model target that served the request. |
| <nobr><code>x-aisix-cache</code></nobr> | Appears on chat cache hit or miss paths. Use it to check whether the gateway served the response from cache. |
| <nobr><code>x-ratelimit-*</code></nobr> | Appears on successful chat-completions responses when the caller API key has rate limits configured. Use it to inspect request, token, and concurrent limit state where applicable. |
| <nobr><code>Retry-After</code></nobr> | Appears on rate-limit, budget, and all-candidates-unavailable rejections when the gateway has a retry hint. Use it to tell callers when to retry. |

## OpenAI-Style Proxy Errors

AISIX OpenAI-compatible proxy errors use this envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "...",
    "type": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

The `param` and `code` fields are omitted when AISIX has no value for them.
Budget denials can include additional budget fields inside the `error` object.

Common AISIX `error.type` values are:

| Error type | Typical status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_api_key` | `401` | Caller authentication is missing or invalid. |
| `permission_denied` | `403` | The caller key is valid but cannot use the requested model. |
| `model_not_found` | `404` | The requested model alias is not configured. |
| `invalid_request_error` | `400` or `413` | The request body or endpoint usage is invalid. Oversized OpenAI-style requests return this error type with status `413`. |
| `provider_unavailable` | `503` | The selected upstream provider adapter cannot complete the request. |
| `all_candidates_unavailable` | `503` | Every routing candidate was filtered out or unavailable. |
| `content_filter` | `422` | The request or response was blocked by policy. |
| `billing_error` | `429` | The request was rejected by billing or budget state. |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | `429` | The request exceeded a configured rate limit. |
| `not_implemented` | `501` | The resolved provider adapter does not implement the requested endpoint. |
| `upstream_error` | Varies, often `502` for upstream server-side failures | The upstream provider returned an error that AISIX rendered through the proxy error format. |

### How Upstream Errors Are Rendered

For upstream provider errors on OpenAI-style routes, AISIX separates
client-safe information from operational detail.

Upstream `4xx` responses keep the client-visible HTTP class and are rendered
through the proxy error format. Where AISIX can parse the upstream provider
error, it preserves or translates provider error semantics into the
OpenAI-style envelope.

Upstream `5xx` responses generally collapse into `502` through the provider
adapter. AISIX does not expose upstream `5xx` response bodies because they can
contain provider-only detail.

## Anthropic-Style Proxy Errors

`POST /v1/messages` and `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` use the
Anthropic-style error envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

The nested `error.type` follows Anthropic SDK-compatible status mappings:

| Status | Anthropic `error.type` |
| --- | --- |
| `400` or `422` | `invalid_request_error` |
| `401` | `authentication_error` |
| `403` | `permission_error` |
| `404` | `not_found_error` |
| `413` | `request_too_large` |
| `429` | `rate_limit_error` |
| `503` | `overloaded_error` |
| Other status codes | `api_error` |

See [Anthropic Messages](../integration/anthropic-messages.md#error-format) for examples.

## Passthrough Errors

`ANY /passthrough/:provider/*rest` forwards the upstream provider's status code
and body unchanged after proxy authentication and provider resolution. See
[Provider passthrough](../integration/passthrough.md).

## Proxy Status Codes

Use the error type first when the envelope includes one. The status code gives
the broad category, but the error type usually identifies the more precise
gateway condition.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | The request is invalid. |
| `401` | Caller authentication is missing or invalid. |
| `403` | The model is not allowed for the key. |
| `404` | The model alias was not found. |
| `413` | The request body exceeds the configured proxy request body limit. |
| `422` | Content was blocked by policy. |
| `429` | The request hit a rate limit or budget rejection. |
| `501` | The resolved provider adapter does not implement the requested endpoint. |
| `502` | The upstream provider returned a server-side failure or the provider adapter mapped an upstream failure into the proxy error format. |
| `503` | The provider adapter is unavailable, or every routing candidate was filtered out by runtime status. |

## Admin Error Envelope

The admin API uses this envelope:

```json
{
  "error_msg": "..."
}
```

Admin status codes are:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | The admin payload is invalid. |
| `401` | Admin authentication is missing or invalid. |
| `404` | The resource was not found. |
| `409` | A resource conflict, such as a duplicate unique field. |
| `500` | A gateway-side admin API failure. |
