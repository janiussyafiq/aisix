API keys authenticate callers on the proxy API.

Clients send the plaintext key in `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key`.
The gateway stores only `key_hash`, the SHA-256 hex digest of that plaintext
key. On each request, the proxy hashes the presented key and looks up the
matching `ApiKey` resource.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, run a self-hosted gateway with the admin and proxy listeners
available, prepare an admin key for `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY`, and
create at least one model alias the caller should be allowed to use.

If you have not created a model yet, configure [Provider keys](provider-keys.md)
and [Models](models.md) first.

## Configure a Caller Key

Create the key resource, give the plaintext key to the caller, and verify the
caller can use the intended model alias.

### Create a Caller Key

Choose the plaintext key you will give to the caller, then hash it before
writing the admin resource.

```shell
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
else
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}'
fi
```

Create the API key resource with that hash:

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/apikeys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_hash": "YOUR_CALLER_KEY_HASH",
    "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod"],
    "rate_limit": {
      "rpm": 60,
      "concurrency": 5
    }
  }'
```

Give the plaintext key to the caller. Do not give the caller `key_hash`.

### Verify Access

First, check what the caller key can see:

```shell
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller"
```

Then send a request to an allowed model alias. The caller uses the plaintext
key, not the hash:

```shell
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

If the key was created successfully but the proxy still returns `401` or `403`,
check configuration propagation before changing the API key, then use the
troubleshooting section below.

## Behavior Details

Review how caller keys control model access, rotation, rate limits, team and
member bindings, and budget checks.

### Model Access

`allowed_models` controls which model aliases the caller may use.

Use explicit allowlists for ordinary callers:

```json
{
  "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod", "chat-prod"]
}
```

Use `["*"]` only when the key should access every model visible to it.

```json
{
  "allowed_models": ["*"]
}
```

An empty array is valid and denies every model.

```json
{
  "allowed_models": []
}
```

`GET /v1/models` applies the same access rules. A wildcard key sees all
non-routing models. A restricted key sees only allowed non-routing models. An
empty allowlist returns an empty list.

### Rotate a Key

`POST /admin/v1/apikeys/:id/rotate` generates a new plaintext bearer, stores
only its hash, and returns the plaintext once.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/apikeys/API_KEY_ID/rotate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "entry": {
    "id": "API_KEY_ID",
    "revision": 2,
    "value": {
      "key_hash": "...",
      "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod"]
    }
  },
  "plaintext": "sk-550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000"
}
```

Capture `plaintext` immediately. Later reads return only the hash. The old key
stops working after the updated resource propagates to the proxy.

### Rate Limits

`ApiKey.rate_limit` is an inline policy on the caller key.

It can limit request count with `rps`, `rpm`, `rph`, and `rpd`; token count
with `tpm` and `tpd`; and in-flight requests with `concurrency`.

The proxy combines `ApiKey.rate_limit`, `Model.rate_limit`, and matching
`RateLimitPolicy` rows with AND semantics.

The tightest applicable layer wins in practice. See [Rate limits](rate-limits.md)
for the full enforcement model.

### Team and Member Bindings

The runtime `ApiKey` schema includes optional `team_id` and `user_id`.

Those fields are bucket identities, not access controls by themselves. The data
plane uses them to match `team`-scoped and `member`-scoped rate-limit policies
and managed budget rows.

The standalone admin API accepts and returns only `key_hash`, `allowed_models`,
and `rate_limit`. It does not set `team_id` or `user_id` on
`/admin/v1/apikeys` requests.

That means team and member bindings are a managed control-plane projection
concern, or a direct config-store concern for self-hosted deployments that
intentionally write runtime rows outside the standalone admin API.

### Budget Behavior

Managed budget enforcement runs on the managed `/dp/budget_check` path.

In standalone self-hosted deployments, the budget client defaults to disabled
and allows requests. The standalone admin API also does not set `team_id` or
`user_id`, so team and member budget scopes do not match keys created through
`/admin/v1/apikeys`.

For budget scope details, see [Budgets](budgets.md).

## Troubleshooting

### A Valid Key Gets `403`

Check `allowed_models` first. `403` usually means the key authenticated but is
not allowed to use the requested model alias.

### A Caller Gets `401`

Check that the client is sending the plaintext key, not `key_hash`. Also check
that the updated API-key resource has propagated to the proxy.

### The Caller Lost Access After Rotation

Make sure the client is using the newly returned plaintext key. The old
plaintext no longer matches the stored hash after rotation propagates.

### Rate-Limit Behavior Does Not Match the Configured Layer

Remember that key, model, and scoped policy layers are combined. If one layer
appears silent, another tighter layer may be the one rejecting requests.
