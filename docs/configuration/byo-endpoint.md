A bring-your-own (BYO) endpoint is any OpenAI-compatible HTTP server you
operate yourself: a [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/) or
[SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/) inference server, an
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) host, or a self-hosted proxy in front of your own
models. Register it with AISIX AI Gateway so callers reach it through the same
OpenAI-compatible proxy API and the same caller API keys as any catalog
provider.

Set `adapter` to `openai` for BYO endpoints. AISIX sends a standard
`POST /chat/completions` request to your endpoint and returns an
OpenAI-compatible chat-completions response to the caller.

## When to Use

Use a BYO endpoint when you run an inference server that exposes the OpenAI
chat-completions API, such as vLLM, SGLang, Ollama, another OpenAI-compatible
proxy, or your own service. This lets a private or air-gapped model share the
gateway's auth, allowlist, rate limiting, and usage accounting.

Do not use this path for AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Azure OpenAI. Those
providers use native APIs and dedicated guides: [AWS Bedrock](../integration/upstream-bedrock.md),
[Google Vertex AI](../integration/upstream-vertex.md), and [Azure OpenAI](../integration/upstream-azure-openai.md).

## Required Resources

A BYO endpoint is configured through a provider key and a model. The
[provider key](provider-keys.md) holds the endpoint credential
(`secret`) and base URL (`api_base`). The direct [model](models.md) maps a
caller-facing alias (`display_name`) to the upstream model ID (`model_name`) and
references the provider key.

Set `api_base` explicitly for every BYO endpoint. AISIX only has a built-in
default for the OpenAI provider itself; it does not guess the base URL for a
private vLLM, SGLang, Ollama, or private proxy endpoint. A BYO provider key
without `api_base` fails before it can reach the upstream.

For private or self-hosted endpoints, set `api_base` to the root where your
server serves the OpenAI-compatible API. If your server serves the OpenAI API at
`http://10.0.0.5:8000/v1`, set exactly that. See
[Provider Keys](provider-keys.md#configure-the-base-url) for base URL guidance
and [Base URL Normalization](provider-keys.md#base-url-normalization) for the
normalization rules.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, run the gateway with admin on `:3001` and proxy on `:3000`,
prepare your admin key from the bootstrap config, and make sure the
OpenAI-compatible endpoint is reachable. The examples below assume vLLM at
`http://10.0.0.5:8000/v1` serving the model ID
`meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`.

:::note vLLM, SGLang, and Ollama Base URLs
Use the `/v1` form for common OpenAI-compatible inference servers:
`http://host:8000/v1` for vLLM, `http://host:30000/v1` for SGLang, and
`http://host:11434/v1` for Ollama. AISIX appends `/chat/completions` to the
configured base URL.
:::

## Configure the BYO Endpoint

Create a provider key, model alias, and caller API key. Together, these
resources let callers send an AISIX model alias while the gateway sends the
served model ID and endpoint credential upstream.

### Create a Provider Key

Many self-hosted inference servers do not require an API key. The `secret`
field is required by the schema, so use a non-empty placeholder when your
endpoint is unauthenticated. AISIX sends it as the bearer token, and your
server can ignore it.

:::warning Production Credentials
The standalone gateway stores `secret` as plaintext under the etcd `prefix`
from [`config.yaml`](bootstrap-config.md). For production, protect etcd with
encryption at rest and restricted network access, or use AISIX Cloud's managed
[Provider Key Rotation](../cloud/provider-key-rotation.md).
:::

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/provider_keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "vllm-private",
    "provider": "vllm",
    "adapter": "openai",
    "secret": "not-used-by-vllm",
    "api_base": "http://10.0.0.5:8000/v1"
  }'
```

Use any short `provider` label that makes sense for your environment, such as
`vllm`, `sglang`, `ollama`, or `private-proxy`. Do not set `provider` to
`openai` unless the upstream is actually OpenAI; that label can allow fallback to
the public OpenAI host if `api_base` is removed.

Set `adapter` to `openai` for a BYO OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Set `api_base`
to the endpoint root your server expects, including `/v1` when that is part of
the server's OpenAI-compatible route.

Save the returned provider key `id` for the model resource.

### Create a Model

Map a caller-facing alias to the upstream model ID your endpoint serves.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "llama-3-private",
    "provider": "vllm",
    "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    "provider_key_id": "YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY_ID",
    "cost": {
      "input_per_1k": 0.0,
      "output_per_1k": 0.0
    }
  }'
```

`display_name` is the alias callers send in `model` and the value
`response.model` echoes back. `model_name` is the upstream id your endpoint
expects; for vLLM and SGLang this is the served model name, and for Ollama it is
the local model tag, such as `llama3.1:8b`. `cost` is optional; see
[Pricing Metadata](#pricing-metadata).

### Create a Caller API Key

AISIX stores `key_hash`, not the plaintext caller key. Hash a plaintext caller
key, then create the key resource scoped to the new alias.

```shell
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
else
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}'
fi
```

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/apikeys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_hash": "YOUR_CALLER_KEY_HASH",
    "allowed_models": ["llama-3-private"]
  }'
```

### Pricing Metadata

Catalog providers carry pricing from the models.dev catalog. A BYO endpoint is
not in that catalog, so the gateway has no price for it unless you set one.

Attach a `cost` block to the model to enable per-token budget accounting:

```json
{
  "cost": {
    "input_per_1k": 0.10,
    "output_per_1k": 0.30
  }
}
```

Both values are in USD per 1,000 tokens. `input_per_1k` applies to prompt
tokens and `output_per_1k` to completion tokens. The gateway multiplies each
token count by its rate and sums them. Both fields are required when the `cost`
block is present.

:::note Pricing Is Enforced in AISIX Cloud, Not Standalone
Standalone self-hosted deployments store `cost` metadata but do not enforce
budget checks from that value at request time. Set `cost` on a BYO model so a
managed deployment, or your own usage-event consumer, has the per-token rate
available. See [Models](models.md#cost-metadata) and [Budgets](budgets.md).
:::

## Send a Test Request

Admin API writes propagate to the proxy asynchronously. If the alias is not
visible immediately, check configuration propagation and retry after the proxy
has loaded the model alias.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3-private",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Say hello from the private model."}
    ]
  }'
```

## Verify the Endpoint

After the test request succeeds, confirm the caller-facing alias and upstream
endpoint.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"llama-3-private","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}' \
  | grep -o '"model":"[^"]*"'
```

The output should be `"model":"llama-3-private"`, your caller-facing alias,
not the upstream `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`. If the upstream ID
appears instead, check that the request is using the AISIX proxy URL and that
the caller key is allowed to use the `llama-3-private` alias.

Check the endpoint access log for a `POST /v1/chat/completions` entry from
AISIX. If AISIX returns an upstream route or connection error, check `api_base`,
the served model name, and endpoint reachability.

## Limitations

BYO is for OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoints. Endpoints with a
different API format need a native adapter. See
[Adapter Protocol Families](../reference/adapters.md).

Always set `api_base` for BYO. A non-`openai` provider key without `api_base`
cannot route requests because AISIX has no endpoint host to call.

Standalone deployments record `cost` metadata but do not enforce budget checks
from that value at request time. See [Pricing Metadata](#pricing-metadata).
