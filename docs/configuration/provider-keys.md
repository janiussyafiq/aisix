Use provider keys to store upstream credentials and endpoint settings separately
from caller-facing model aliases.

A direct [model](models.md) references a provider key by `provider_key_id`.
With this separation, you can reuse one upstream credential across multiple
models and rotate that credential without recreating every alias.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, run a self-hosted gateway with the admin listener available,
prepare an admin key for `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY`, and collect an
upstream provider credential or private endpoint credential.

Provider keys store sensitive upstream credentials. Decide who owns the upstream
credential before sharing the key across many models.

## Configure a Provider Key

Create the provider key first, then attach the returned `id` to a model and
verify that the admin API can read the credential resource.

### Create a Provider Key

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/provider_keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "openai-prod",
    "provider": "openai",
    "adapter": "openai",
    "secret": "YOUR_PROVIDER_API_KEY",
    "api_base": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  }'
```

Use the returned `id` as the model's `provider_key_id`.

```json
{
  "display_name": "gpt-4o-prod",
  "provider": "openai",
  "model_name": "gpt-4o",
  "provider_key_id": "PROVIDER_KEY_ID_FROM_ADMIN_API"
}
```

:::warning Production Credentials
The standalone gateway stores `secret` as plaintext under the etcd `prefix`
configured in [`config.yaml`](bootstrap-config.md). Anyone with read access to
that etcd keyspace can read the credential. In production, restrict etcd
network access, use encryption at rest where available, and keep the
gateway-to-etcd channel inside trusted infrastructure.
:::

### Verify the Provider Key

Confirm the admin API can read the provider key:

```shell
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/provider_keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY"
```

The provider key is not useful by itself on the proxy request path. To verify
end-to-end traffic, attach it to a [model](models.md), allow that model on a
caller [API key](api-keys.md), and send a proxy request.

## Understand Provider and Adapter

`provider` and `adapter` are separate fields:

| Field | Purpose | Example Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | Identifies the upstream vendor or endpoint. It is an open string. | `openai`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`, `openrouter`, `private-vllm` |
| `adapter` | Identifies the upstream API format. It is a closed enum because AISIX can only encode implemented protocol families. | `openai`, `anthropic`, `bedrock`, `vertex`, `azure-openai` |

At request time, the gateway uses provider-specific handling when available;
otherwise it uses the configured adapter family. This is why a long-tail
OpenAI-compatible provider can use `adapter: "openai"` with its own `provider`
and `api_base`.

For how AISIX selects the request format, see
[Adapter protocol families](../reference/adapters.md).

## Behavior Details

The fields below control upstream URL construction, passthrough credential
handling, provider-specific compatibility overrides, and rotation behavior.

### Configure the Base URL

`api_base` controls where the gateway sends upstream requests.

The safest rule is: configure the base URL exactly as the selected adapter
expects. The gateway tolerates common copy-paste forms, but it does not try to
guess arbitrary provider URL layouts.

Use these common patterns:

| Upstream | `adapter` | `api_base` pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| DeepSeek | `openai` | `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| Gemini OpenAI-compatible API | `openai` | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `https://api.anthropic.com` |
| Azure OpenAI | `azure-openai` | `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com` |
| AWS Bedrock | `bedrock` | usually unset |
| Google Vertex AI | `vertex` | `https://<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com` |

For OpenAI itself:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "adapter": "openai",
  "api_base": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
}
```

For DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible API:

```json
{
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "adapter": "openai",
  "api_base": "https://api.deepseek.com"
}
```

For Gemini's OpenAI-compatible API:

```json
{
  "provider": "google",
  "adapter": "openai",
  "api_base": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai"
}
```

For Anthropic, AISIX appends `/v1/messages`.

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "adapter": "anthropic",
  "api_base": "https://api.anthropic.com"
}
```

For Azure OpenAI, a bare resource name is also accepted. AISIX builds the
deployment URL from the selected model name and API version.

```json
{
  "provider": "azure",
  "adapter": "azure-openai",
  "api_base": "https://example-resource.openai.azure.com"
}
```

For Bedrock, `api_base` is usually unset. The region comes from the Bedrock
credential JSON in `secret`, and the gateway builds the Bedrock Runtime
endpoint. Set `api_base` only when routing through a private or custom Bedrock
endpoint.

For Vertex AI, project, region, and token endpoint details come from the
service-account JSON in `secret`.

```json
{
  "provider": "google-vertex",
  "adapter": "vertex",
  "api_base": "https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com"
}
```

### Base URL Normalization

The gateway normalizes common `api_base` paste mistakes:

- leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed
- trailing slashes are removed
- full endpoint URLs such as `/chat/completions`, `/embeddings`, `/v1/messages`,
  and `/audio/transcriptions` are reduced to the expected base URL
- OpenAI's host can be supplied with or without `/v1`
- DeepSeek's host tolerates an accidental `/v1`
- Anthropic tolerates bare host, `/v1`, and `/v1/messages`

This tolerance is conservative. For corporate proxies, private gateways, or
custom paths, the gateway preserves the configured base after basic trimming
and endpoint-suffix cleanup. It does not invent `/v1` for an unknown host.

### Passthrough Header Stripping

The passthrough endpoint uses the selected provider key to add the upstream
credential. To avoid forwarding caller credentials to the upstream provider,
the gateway strips these headers by default:

```text
authorization
cookie
set-cookie
x-api-key
```

`strip_headers` lets you customize the list. Entries are trimmed, lowercased,
deduplicated, and empty entries are dropped on load. Hop-by-hop headers such as
`host` and `content-length` are stripped separately and cannot be re-enabled
through `strip_headers`.

Only change this field when you have a concrete forwarding requirement and
accept the credential-leak risk. For endpoint behavior, see
[Passthrough](../integration/passthrough.md).

### Compatibility Overrides

Provider keys can include optional `request` and `response` override blocks for
provider compatibility. Examples include parameter renames, temperature clamps,
default outbound headers, default body fields, content-list flattening, stream
done-marker policy, and reasoning-field extraction.

These blocks are advanced compatibility settings. AISIX accepts the
configuration at write time, but each provider adapter decides which overrides
apply to its request path. Verify adapter behavior before relying on an
override for a specific provider family.

For exact field definitions, see
[Provider key schema](../reference/provider-key-schema).

### Rotation Behavior

Provider keys are shared dependencies. Rotating one provider key affects every
model that references it.

Duplicate `display_name` values are rejected with `409`.

A model that points at a newly written provider key can fail temporarily until
the proxy has received both resources. See
[Configuration propagation](configuration-propagation.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Requests Fail After Changing the Base URL

Treat this first as an upstream URL construction issue. Confirm the provider
key's `provider`, `adapter`, and `api_base` match the upstream protocol family.

### Several Models Fail After Provider-Key Rotation

Check whether they share the same provider key. If they do, the rotated key is
the common dependency.

### A Bring-Your-Own Endpoint Fails Without a Base URL

Configure `api_base` explicitly. The OpenAI-family adapter refuses to fall back
to `api.openai.com` for non-OpenAI provider identities.
