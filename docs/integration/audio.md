AISIX AI Gateway exposes OpenAI-style audio routes for transcription,
translation, and speech generation.

Use these endpoints when audio clients should keep OpenAI request formats while
AISIX manages caller authentication, model aliases, and upstream credentials.

## Audio Request Flow

Transcription and translation requests use `multipart/form-data`. Speech
requests use JSON.

For multipart requests, the gateway resolves the AISIX model alias and rebuilds
the multipart form with the upstream model id before forwarding. It preserves
the other form fields, including file name and content type when present.

For transcription and translation, the client still sends the AISIX alias,
while the upstream receives the provider model id.

The gateway relays the upstream response body and response content type.
Transcription and translation responses are JSON results. Speech responses are
binary audio bytes.

Your client should handle the response based on the endpoint family, not only on
the fact that the request goes through the gateway. Do not rely on AISIX to
normalize audio responses into a chat-style JSON body.

These endpoints follow the same proxy rules as other client-facing routes:
caller API key authentication, model alias resolution, and `allowed_models`
enforcement.

## Provider Support

Audio requests are forwarded to the resolved provider key's `api_base` with the
AISIX model alias rewritten to the upstream model id.

The gateway does not translate audio request or response formats across provider
families. Use these endpoints with upstreams that expose the same OpenAI-style
audio routes: `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, `/v1/audio/translations`, and
`/v1/audio/speech`.

If a provider does not expose the requested audio route, the failure is an
upstream capability or base-URL issue, not a caller-auth issue.

Successful audio requests are attributed in gateway usage events. Token counts
are populated only when the upstream response includes a recognized `usage`
block; speech output and duration-based audio costs are not inferred from the
binary response.

## Choose an Audio Endpoint

Use transcriptions for speech-to-text, translations for speech-to-text with
translation semantics, and speech for text-to-audio output.

## Troubleshooting

### Multipart Request Returns `400`

Check form construction first. Confirm the file upload fields and the
presence of `model`.

### Speech Output Is Not JSON

`/v1/audio/speech` returns upstream audio bytes rather than a chat-style JSON
body. Handle the response as binary output.

### The Request Returns an Upstream `404`

Check whether the resolved provider exposes the requested OpenAI-style audio
route and whether `api_base` points to the route root the gateway should append
`/v1/audio/...` to.
