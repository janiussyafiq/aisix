AISIX AI Gateway can route OpenAI-compatible chat requests to [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs).
Callers can reach Vertex-hosted Gemini and partner models through the gateway.

Register GCP credentials, map a caller-facing alias to a Vertex model ID, and
send requests through the gateway's proxy API. The provider key uses
`adapter: vertex`, and AISIX authenticates to Vertex with a GCP OAuth2 bearer
token.

## Use Cases

This setup is for models that run on Google Vertex AI and need gateway
authentication, model allowlists, rate limiting, and usage accounting. The Vertex
adapter can mint and cache GCP access tokens from a service-account key, so
callers do not manage token refresh.

For models you host yourself, use [Bring Your Own Endpoint](../configuration/byo-endpoint.md)
instead.

## Vertex Request Routing

AISIX chooses the Vertex route from the configured `model_name`.

Gemini models such as `gemini-*` use the Google publisher route,
`publishers/google/models/<model>:generateContent`, or
`:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` for streaming.

Anthropic models such as `claude-*` use the Anthropic publisher raw-predict
route with an Anthropic Messages body and `anthropic_version:
"vertex-2023-10-16"`.

OpenAI-compatible Model Garden partner models, including `meta/*`, `llama*`,
`deepseek*`, `qwen*`, `openai/gpt-oss*`, `minimaxai/*`, `moonshotai/*`, and
`zai-org/*`, use the Vertex `endpoints/openapi/chat/completions` route with the
model ID in the body.

Mistral models such as `mistral-*` and `codestral-*` use the Mistral publisher
raw-predict route with an OpenAI-compatible body. AI21 models such as `jamba-*`
use the AI21 publisher raw-predict route with an OpenAI-compatible body.

For every supported publisher, AISIX reads the GCP credential from the provider
key's `secret`, obtains an OAuth2 access token, and sends the Vertex request
with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

```

## Credential Modes

The provider key's `secret` is a JSON object carrying `project`, `region`, and
exactly one credential mode. Use `service_account_json` for the full GCP
service-account JSON key. Use `access_token` only when you already manage and
refresh a pre-minted GCP OAuth2 bearer token.

With `service_account_json`, AISIX signs a JWT with the service account's RSA
private key and exchanges it for an OAuth2 access token at the service account's
`token_uri`. The gateway caches the token for reuse and refreshes it about 60
seconds before its reported expiry.

With `access_token`, the gateway uses the provided bearer token directly. GCP
token TTL is roughly one hour, so this mode is best suited to short-lived test
environments or an existing token-minting pipeline.

AISIX rejects a provider key that sets both credential modes or neither mode.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, run the gateway with the admin API on `:3001` and the proxy
API on `:3000`, prepare your admin key from the bootstrap config, and enable
the Vertex AI API in the target GCP project. You also need a region, such as
`us-central1`, and a service-account key with the Vertex AI user role.

Prepare the GCP project ID, Vertex region, service-account JSON key or
pre-minted access token, Vertex publisher model ID, caller-facing alias, and
optional proxy or private endpoint host.

## Configure the Vertex Upstream

Create a Vertex provider key, model alias, and caller API key. The provider key
stores the GCP project, region, and credential mode; the model selects the
Vertex publisher model ID.

### Create a Vertex Provider Key

The `secret` is a JSON string. The example below uses the
`service_account_json` mode. Embed the service-account JSON as a nested object
inside the secret.

:::warning Production Credentials
The standalone gateway stores `secret` as plaintext under the etcd `prefix`
from [`config.yaml`](../configuration/bootstrap-config.md). For production,
protect etcd with encryption at rest and restricted network access, or use
AISIX Cloud's managed [Provider Key Rotation](../cloud/provider-key-rotation.md).
:::

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/provider_keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "vertex-prod",
    "provider": "google-vertex",
    "adapter": "vertex",
    "secret": "{\"project\":\"my-gcp-project\",\"region\":\"us-central1\",\"service_account_json\":{\"type\":\"service_account\",\"private_key\":\"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nYOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\"client_email\":\"vertex-sa@my-gcp-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\"token_uri\":\"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\"}}"
  }'
```

The `secret` must include the GCP project id and Vertex region. The region
drives the `<region>-aiplatform.googleapis.com` host unless you override
`api_base`.

For credentials, include exactly one mode: `service_account_json` for OAuth
token minting, or `access_token` for a pre-minted token you refresh yourself.

Set `adapter` to `vertex`. Use a provider label that identifies the upstream;
the example uses `google-vertex`.

If you route Vertex traffic through a corporate proxy, set `api_base` on the
provider key to the proxy host. AISIX appends the publisher-specific
`/v1/projects/...` path.

Save the returned `id` for the model resource.

### Create a Model

`model_name` is the Vertex publisher model ID. The caller-facing alias is
`display_name`.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "display_name": "gemini-prod",
    "provider": "google-vertex",
    "model_name": "gemini-1.5-pro",
    "provider_key_id": "YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY_ID"
  }'
```

Other supported examples include `claude-sonnet-4-5` for Anthropic on Vertex,
`meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-maas` for OpenAI-compatible partner models,
`mistral-large-2411` for Mistral, and `jamba-1.5-large` for AI21.

### Create a Caller API Key

```shell
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
else
  printf '%s' 'sk-demo-caller' | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print $1}'
fi
```

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin/v1/apikeys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_hash": "YOUR_CALLER_KEY_HASH",
    "allowed_models": ["gemini-prod"]
  }'
```

## Send a Test Request

Admin API writes propagate to the proxy asynchronously. If the alias is not
visible immediately, check configuration propagation and retry after the proxy
has loaded the model alias. The example below uses
Gemini. Gemini requires at least one user or assistant turn; a system-only
request is rejected before the provider request.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-prod",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Say hello from Vertex."}
    ]
  }'
```

The gateway returns an OpenAI-compatible response with the caller-facing alias:

```json
{
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "gemini-prod",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello from Vertex!"},
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4, "completion_tokens": 4, "total_tokens": 8}
}
```

## Verify the Vertex Upstream

After the test request succeeds, confirm the caller-facing alias and Vertex
request.

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo-caller" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gemini-prod","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}' \
  | grep -o '"model":"[^"]*"'
```

The output should be `"model":"gemini-prod"`, your caller-facing alias, not
`gemini-1.5-pro`.

AISIX sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and calls the route family
selected from `model_name`: Gemini uses the Google publisher
`:generateContent` route, Anthropic on Vertex uses the Anthropic
`:rawPredict` route, OpenAI-compatible partner models use
`endpoints/openapi/chat/completions`, and Mistral or AI21 models use their
publisher `:rawPredict` routes.

Check Vertex logs, metrics, quota usage, or provider-side request records for
the test request. If AISIX returns a token-minting or upstream authentication
error, check the service-account key, region, Vertex API enablement, IAM role,
and model access.

## Limitations

Publisher selection is prefix-based. If `model_name` does not match a
supported prefix, the gateway rejects the request before the provider request
with an unsupported-publisher configuration error.

The end-to-end example uses Gemini because it is the most common Vertex path.
For partner models, validate the exact `model_name`, quota, and regional
availability in your Vertex project before exposing the alias to callers.

Provider-key request and response overrides can apply on Vertex routes, but
they are most directly useful on OpenAI-compatible routes. Gemini's native
`contents` format does not match every OpenAI-style override target.
