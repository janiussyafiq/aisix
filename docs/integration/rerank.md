AISIX AI Gateway exposes `POST /v1/rerank` as a rerank proxy endpoint for
OpenAI, Cohere, and Jina-style rerank providers.

Use this endpoint when rerank calls should use the same caller keys and model
aliases as the rest of the gateway.

## Send a Rerank Request

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/rerank \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "rerank-prod",
    "query": "gateway docs",
    "documents": ["doc a", "doc b", "doc c"]
  }'
```

## Provider and Gateway Behavior

For rerank requests, AISIX authenticates the caller key, resolves the AISIX
model alias, checks `allowed_models`, rewrites `model` to the upstream provider
model id, and forwards the remaining request fields without changing them.

The gateway builds the upstream target with `/v1/rerank`. It tolerates the
common case where `api_base` already ends in `/v1`, so you can configure either
a provider host or the API root from the provider's reference.

For rerank-capable models, confirm `ProviderKey.api_base` before debugging
caller authentication or model allowlists.

The gateway accepts rerank requests only when the resolved model's `provider`
is `openai`, `cohere`, or `jina`.

Requests for Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Bedrock, Vertex, Azure OpenAI, and
other providers are rejected with `400` before the provider request.

Voyage AI is not in this provider set even though it exposes a rerank API. Its
request and response fields differ from the OpenAI/Cohere/Jina format, so it
needs a dedicated adapter before it can be treated as compatible.

For Cohere and Jina, configure the provider key `api_base` for the API root in
the provider's reference. If the base URL is wrong, rerank failures are usually
configuration mistakes rather than caller-auth issues.

Successful rerank responses are relayed as upstream bytes. The gateway parses
the body only to extract usage for telemetry when the provider returns a
recognized usage format.

## Troubleshooting

### The Request Returns an Upstream `404`

Check the rerank provider base URL first. The gateway targets the provider's
`/v1/rerank` route and de-duplicates common `/v1` paste variants, but it does
not guess vendor-specific path prefixes beyond that.

### The Request Returns `400` Before Reaching the Provider

Check the model's `provider`. The gateway accepts only `openai`,
`cohere`, and `jina` on `/v1/rerank`.
