AISIX AI Gateway supports streaming on its client-facing proxy API. Streaming
support depends on the endpoint family, resolved provider, and response format
the client expects.

## Streaming Support

Use `/v1/chat/completions` for the default OpenAI-compatible streaming path.
Use `/v1/messages` when your client is already built around Anthropic-style
events. Anthropic upstreams stream natively on this path; non-Anthropic
upstreams stream through translation.

Use `/v1/responses` only when you specifically need the OpenAI Responses API
and the resolved provider is OpenAI.

## Streaming Behavior

### OpenAI-Style Streaming

For `/v1/chat/completions`, the gateway returns OpenAI-style SSE chunks.

This is the main streaming path used by OpenAI-compatible SDKs, SSE consumers,
and applications that incrementally render assistant output.

Example request:

```shell
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Stream a short greeting."}
    ]
  }'
```

The client receives standard OpenAI-style SSE chunks followed by the stream
completion semantics from its SDK or SSE parser.

### Anthropic-Style Streaming

For `/v1/messages`, the gateway returns Anthropic-style SSE events.

When the resolved model provider is Anthropic, upstream SSE is passed through.
For non-Anthropic upstreams, gateway chat chunks are translated into Anthropic
event types such as `message_start`, `content_block_*`, `message_delta`, and
`message_stop`.

Use this path when your client already expects Anthropic-style streaming events
and you do not want to change client-side parsing.

### Responses API Streaming

`POST /v1/responses` supports both JSON and streaming SSE, but only for models
whose configured provider is `openai`.

Non-OpenAI models receive `400` on this endpoint.

That means `responses` is not a general-purpose multi-provider streaming entry
point.

## Interrupted Streams

If a client aborts a stream mid-response, the gateway remains healthy and
continues serving later requests.

:::note
Do not rely on partial upstream chunks when the upstream disconnects mid-stream
unless the endpoint reference states that behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### The Client Hangs Waiting for Chunks

Check that the request actually includes `stream: true` and that your client is
using a streaming-aware API path.

### `/v1/responses` Streaming Returns `400`

The resolved model is likely not an OpenAI provider.

### The Stream Is Interrupted and Later Requests Fail

Inspect gateway logs and health endpoints. Later requests continue to be served
after an interrupted stream.
