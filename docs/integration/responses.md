AISIX AI Gateway exposes `POST /v1/responses` as a proxy for the OpenAI
Responses API.

Use this endpoint only when your application specifically depends on the OpenAI
Responses API. If you want the broadest model and provider
compatibility, use [OpenAI-compatible chat completions](openai-compatible-api.md)
instead.

## Send a Responses Request

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-prod",
    "input": "Say hello from AISIX."
  }'
```

Use `/v1/responses` when your application is already standardized on that
OpenAI API. Use `/v1/chat/completions` when you want the broadest
compatibility across provider-backed models.

## Provider and Gateway Behavior

This endpoint is available only for models whose configured provider is
`openai`.

If the resolved model points to any non-OpenAI provider, the gateway returns
`400`.

This is stricter than using the `openai` adapter. An OpenAI-compatible vendor can
work on `/v1/chat/completions` and still be rejected on `/v1/responses` if the
model's `provider` is not `openai`.

For supported models, AISIX authenticates and authorizes the caller key,
verifies that the resolved model is an OpenAI provider, rewrites `model` to the
upstream provider model id, and forwards the body to the upstream
`/v1/responses` endpoint. The response returns as JSON or streaming SSE
depending on the request.

This path is a provider-specific proxy, not a cross-provider compatibility
layer.

For non-streaming successful responses, the gateway records usage when the
upstream response includes the Responses API `usage` block. Streaming responses
are passed through as SSE; the gateway does not parse the stream for usage on
this path.

## Troubleshooting

### The Same Alias Works for Chat Completions but Not for Responses

That usually means the alias resolves to a non-OpenAI provider.

### Streaming Works but Usage Is Not Visible in Gateway Analytics

Streaming `/v1/responses` is passed through without stream parsing on this
path. Use non-streaming `/v1/responses` when gateway-side usage attribution for
this route is required.
