AISIX AI Gateway exposes `POST /v1/embeddings` as an OpenAI-compatible
embeddings endpoint.

Applications can generate vectors through the gateway while keeping
OpenAI-compatible request formats and gateway-managed provider credentials.

## Send an Embeddings Request

```shell
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CALLER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "text-embedding-prod",
    "input": ["hello", "world"]
  }'
```

Use embeddings for semantic search indexing, retrieval pipelines, and cache-key
or clustering workflows that depend on vector representations.

## Provider and Request Behavior

Embeddings depend on the resolved provider adapter. OpenAI-compatible providers
can use the OpenAI embeddings path. Providers that do not implement embeddings
return `501 Not Implemented` with error type `not_implemented`.

This is different from `/v1/responses` and `/v1/images/generations`, which are
gated on `provider: "openai"`. For embeddings, the question is whether the
resolved provider supports embeddings for the model you configured.

The gateway accepts a single string or an array of strings and preserves the
caller's original request format when it forwards the request upstream. Callers
do not need separate client-side logic to switch between a single input and a
batch input.

Successful responses follow the OpenAI embeddings format: `object: "list"`,
one `data[]` entry per normalized input item, and a `usage` block when the
upstream provider returns token usage.

For each request, AISIX authenticates the caller key, resolves the model alias,
checks `allowed_models`, rewrites `model` to the upstream provider model id,
and returns an OpenAI-style embeddings response.

The gateway records usage when the upstream returns token usage. Embeddings do
not use completion tokens, response caching, streaming, or guardrails on this
proxy path.

## Troubleshooting

### A Provider Returns `501`

The resolved provider does not implement embeddings on this gateway path.

### A Batch Request Returns Fewer Vectors Than Expected

The response should return one embedding entry per input item. If fewer vectors
come back, inspect the upstream response and gateway logs for provider-specific
batch handling.
