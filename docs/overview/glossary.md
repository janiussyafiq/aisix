The glossary defines terms that appear across AISIX AI Gateway and AISIX Cloud.

Page-specific identifiers, such as the `bedrock` guardrail kind or the
`YOUR_ADMIN_KEY` placeholder format, are explained where they appear.

## Gateway

The AISIX runtime binary that accepts caller traffic on the proxy listener and
forwards it to upstream model providers. Synonym: data plane.

## Data Plane

The request-handling tier.

It receives caller traffic, applies authentication, model access checks,
routing, rate limits, cache policies, guardrails, budget checks when enabled,
and observability, then forwards requests to upstream providers.

## Control Plane

The management tier.

In standalone deployments, the control plane is the gateway's admin listener,
which writes dynamic resources to [etcd](#etcd). In AISIX Cloud, the control
plane is a hosted service that projects environment-scoped configuration to
managed data planes.

## AISIX Cloud

The managed control-plane service operated separately from the gateway runtime.
It provides hosted environment management and Cloud-only controls such as
budget checks. See [Deployment modes](deployment-modes.md) for the comparison.

## Model

The caller-facing model alias clients send in the request body.

A direct model maps that alias to an upstream provider key and upstream model
name. A routing model maps the alias to one or more target models and lets the
gateway choose the target at request time.

## API Key

Also called the **caller key**. The bearer token your clients send in the
`Authorization` header on the proxy listener.

API keys are created through `POST /admin/v1/apikeys`. The data plane stores
`key_hash`, not plaintext. In the standalone admin API, create or generate the
plaintext bearer, hash it, and write the SHA-256 hash to the API-key resource.

The rotate endpoint, `POST /admin/v1/apikeys/:id/rotate`, is the only endpoint
that returns a server-generated plaintext key. It returns that plaintext once.

## Provider Key

The upstream provider credential the gateway uses on outbound requests. Created
via the admin API's `POST /admin/v1/provider_keys`. Distinct from the
[API key](#api-key) your callers send to the gateway.

## Rate-Limit Policy

A standalone rate-limit rule that targets a scope such as API key, model, team,
or member. The proxy evaluates matching policy rows together with inline limits
on API keys and models.

## Guardrail

A request- or response-policy object applied by the gateway. Configured via the
admin API's `/admin/v1/guardrails`. Supported kinds include local `keyword`
guardrails and remote guardrails for AWS Bedrock and Azure Content Safety. See
[Core concepts guardrail](core-concepts.md#guardrail) for the runtime
behavior.

## Cache Policy

A policy object that controls when chat-completion response cache lookup and
storage apply. The runtime cache backend is selected from bootstrap
configuration; a policy controls matching and TTL, not the process-level
backend.

## Observability Exporter

An admin resource that ships per-request span telemetry over OTLP/HTTP to an
external backend such as Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, or Langfuse.

Configure an observability exporter when you want request traces from gateway
proxy activity in your tracing backend. This is separate from process-wide
bootstrap observability such as service name, log level, and the Prometheus
scrape endpoint. See [Bootstrap configuration](../configuration/bootstrap-config.md).

## etcd

The key-value store the gateway uses for dynamic configuration. The data plane
watches etcd for live resource updates, so most configuration changes do not
require a gateway restart.
