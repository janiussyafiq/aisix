AISIX Cloud and the managed data plane are designed so that temporary
control-plane connectivity loss does not immediately remove the data
plane's ability to serve from its latest accepted configuration.

Once a managed data plane has valid projected configuration, it can continue
serving live traffic from that configuration while Cloud connectivity is being
restored.

## Available During Connectivity Loss

During a temporary control-plane outage, the managed data plane can keep
serving requests from its latest projected configuration. That includes
the models, keys, policies, and routing state already accepted by the
data plane.

On restart, the data plane can use its persisted configuration state while it
reconnects. This helps avoid turning every transient Cloud connectivity
issue into an immediate traffic outage.

## Cloud-Dependent Workflows

Offline resilience does not make the control plane optional. New
configuration changes, updated resource projection, certificate rotation,
usage telemetry delivery, fresh budget decisions, heartbeat, and managed
health reporting all depend on restored managed connectivity.

Use offline resilience as a continuity mechanism for already-projected
configuration, not as a long-term disconnected operating mode.

## Troubleshooting

### Traffic Still Flows, but New Changes Do Not Apply

This is consistent with the resilience model. The data plane can serve from its
latest accepted configuration while new projected configuration waits for Cloud
connectivity to recover.

Check that the data plane can reach the data-plane-manager endpoint, the
certificate is valid and chains to the expected trust root, heartbeat recovers
after connectivity returns, and new projected configuration reaches the data
plane after recovery.

### Usage or Budget State Looks Delayed

Check telemetry delivery and budget-check connectivity. Live request
success does not confirm that every Cloud-side workflow is healthy.
