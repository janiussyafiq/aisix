AISIX Cloud organizes managed gateway resources by organization and
environment. These concepts do not exist as first-class resources in a
standalone self-hosted gateway, but they are central to managed
operation.

An organization owns Cloud resources. An environment defines the managed
deployment scope that receives projected gateway configuration.

## Environment Scope

An organization answers ownership: which tenant, account, or platform
team owns the Cloud resources.

An environment answers placement: which managed data plane should receive
this model, key, or policy.

For most traffic and troubleshooting work, the environment is the most
important unit. Models, provider keys, API keys, and policies must belong
to the environment that the target managed data plane serves.

## Managed Mode Differences

In self-hosted mode, teams usually reason about one gateway runtime and its
etcd-backed configuration. In Cloud mode, teams reason about
environment-scoped resources that are projected into one or more managed data
planes.

That changes the first troubleshooting check. Confirm that the resource exists,
then confirm that it belongs to the environment served by the target data plane.

## Common Checks

When a resource does not appear to affect live traffic, confirm the resource
belongs to the expected environment, the managed data plane is attached to that
environment, projection status and data-plane health are current, and the
request goes through the managed data plane rather than only through a Cloud UI
check.
