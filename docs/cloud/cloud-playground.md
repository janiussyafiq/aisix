The AISIX Cloud playground lets you try a model from the control plane
while you are setting up Cloud resources. It is useful for early feedback,
but it does not simulate the full production request path.

Use live requests through the managed data plane when you need to validate
routing, cache, guardrails, rate limits, budgets, or observability.

## Playground and Live Traffic Paths

Playground requests run from the control plane to the upstream provider. They
do not exercise managed data-plane behavior such as model routing, response
caching, guardrail execution, rate-limit enforcement, budget enforcement, or
data-plane observability.

That difference matters when a playground request succeeds but a live managed
request behaves differently.

The playground is appropriate for model-selection checks, early provider
credential validation, exploratory prompts from the Cloud UI, and basic
provider-call confirmation. The managed data plane is the right place to
validate caller API keys, model aliases, routing rules, cache behavior,
guardrails, budgets, rate limits, logs, and metrics.

## Troubleshooting

### The Playground Succeeds but Managed Traffic Behaves Differently

Treat the playground result as an early provider and configuration check, then
verify the live data-plane path. Confirm the resource belongs to the
environment served by the data plane, the saved resource reached the managed
data plane, the request uses the managed data-plane endpoint, and data-plane
logs, metrics, and gateway response headers match the live request.
