AISIX Cloud stores environment-scoped resources in the control plane and
projects them into the managed data plane. Projection is the Cloud
equivalent of standalone configuration propagation, with an explicit
control-plane to data-plane handoff.

Projection is the step that turns saved Cloud resource state into live
data-plane behavior.

## Projection Path

  save[Save resource in Cloud] --> project[Project environment config]
  project --> receive[Data plane receives config]
  receive --> serve[Live traffic uses new config]
```

Projection has four distinct events: the resource is saved in Cloud, Cloud
projects the environment configuration, the managed data plane receives the
projected configuration, and live traffic starts using the new configuration.

Projection is usually fast, but it is asynchronous. A successful save in
Cloud does not confirm that every data-plane instance is already serving
the new state.

## Projection Behavior

During temporary control-plane connectivity issues, a data plane can continue
serving from its latest projected configuration. Validate live behavior through
the managed data plane, not only through the Cloud UI or API response. If
multiple data-plane instances are attached, they can briefly converge at
different times.

## Troubleshooting

### Cloud Shows the New Resource, but Live Traffic Does Not Use It

Confirm the resource belongs to the same environment as the target data plane,
the data plane is healthy and connected, the projected configuration has
reached the data plane, and the request is sent to the managed data plane
rather than only to a Cloud UI check.

If the resource is a model, also confirm the caller is using the expected
model alias. If the resource is a provider key or policy, confirm the
model references the updated resource.
